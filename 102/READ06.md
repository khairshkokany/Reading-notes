# Logical operators 
## For Loop
**The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: ... for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {""}**

1. Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).
2. Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).
3. Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
## while loop 
**The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
while (condition) {""}** 

> the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) *for example*  is less than 10:
