# Java Script

* ## introudction of JS :-
***JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.***
* ## why we used JS :-
***JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.***

### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators :-
1. #### Operator	Description

|Operator |Discreption    |
|---------|---------------|
|+	      |Addition       |
|-	      |Subtraction    |
|*	      |Multiplication |
|**       |Exponentiation |
|/        |Division       |
|%        |Division       |
|++       |Division       |
|--       |Division       |

2.  #### JavaScript Assignment Operators

|Operator |Example        |
|---------|---------------|
|=	      |x = y          |
|+=	      |x = x + y      |
|-=	      |x = x - y      |
|*=       |x = x * y      |
|/=       |x = x / y      |
|%=       |x = x % y      |
|**=      |x = ** y       |

3.  #### JavaScript String Operators

that meaning and text between "" it will be strong 
for example :- 

var x = "khair"

the string opreators is khair 

if we need to make a number with string :-  

var x = 5

var y = "khair"

x += y will  be 5khair 

if we changed the khair for 8 with ""

the answer will be 58

4. JavaScript compartion Operators :-

|Operator   |Description                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
|==         |	equal to                            |     
|===	      |equal value and equal type           |
|!=         |	not equal                           |
|!==	      |not equal value or not equal type    |
|>          |	greater than                        |
|<	        |less than                            |
|>=         |	greater than or equal to            |
|<=	        |less than or equal to                |
|?	        |ternary Operator                     |



## control flow 
*** Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. ... At the level of machine language or assembly language, control flow instructions usually work by altering the program counter.***

** we used for example IF and if else and else alone **

* console.log "to see the results in console tab "
* document.write "to see what are you type or insert in ur web page to users "
