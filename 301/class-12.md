## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| - | - |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.|
| SQL databases are table based databases | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. |
| SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.|

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?Give a real world example.**

For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

## sql vs nosql

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language

**What is a realational database?**

Database which works with certain assumptions and it supports SQL .

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

SQL structure, tables.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

Collection of database objects linked with a particular database username. which is called Schema owner

**What is a NoSQL database? How does it work?**

Unstructured uses collections instead of tables , collections have documents (can use different structures / no schema applied).

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Documents, collections and many different data that are not applied to schema or relations.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB is more flexible, because you store your data where ever you want, you don't have to follow a schema,

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Having a duplicate data.
