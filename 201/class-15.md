## Teams 

## the teams , we must to know what the team we need and the what the member of team thinking about , and can i thinking the same or the range of them , we must to think corectly and together  to make a best idea we need , in the begin we need   a boss for our team to let him actually originaizing our team let me explain example to let you know the important of workteam , if we have a project and we need to make it what we must tot do , 
1. first , let know all team what is the project .
2. secound , make all team member thinking about the project and explain the ideas of project ,
3. third , start in the project , 
if you have a problem in the project when you alone it's not good and i think yoiu will stuck in a lot of team with search or somthing like that 
**when you have a team you will explain the problem then all team will thinking about the problem and this is faster than you alone and you will get a perfect slution for the problem and in the end you will got a good project without any mistake in it .**
