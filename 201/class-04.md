## LINKS 
### HTML Links - Hyperlinks

* HTML links are hyperlinks.

* You can click on a link and jump to another document.

* When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

### HTML Links - Syntax

The HTML < a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

> < a href="url">link text</ a>
* The most important attribute of the < a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

* The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

* Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

### HTML Links - The target Attribute

- By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

> The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

> The target attribute can have one of the following values:

* _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
* _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
* _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
* _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

### Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

* Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

* A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

> and others ....

## LAYOUT
### Header
#### A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name:




### Navigation Bar

#### A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website:



### Content
#### The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

* column (often used for mobile browsers)
* column (often used for tablets and laptops)
* column layout (only used for desktops)


### Unequal Columns

#### The main content is the biggest and the most important part of your site.
#### It is common with unequal column widths, so that most of the space is reserved for the main content. The side content (if any) is often used as an alternative navigation or to specify information relevant to the main content. Change the widths as you like, only remember that it should add up to 100% in total:

### Footer

#### The footer is placed at the bottom of your page. It often contains information like copyright and contact info:

## FUNCTION 
* WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
### A BASIC FUNCTION 
### declaring a function 
#### to create a function , you give it a name and then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. 
#### this is known as a function declaration.

### calling a function 
#### having declared the function , you can then execute all of the statmens betweeen its curly braces with just one line of code . 

### declearing functions that need information 
#### sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. 
* WHAT IS AN OBJECT?.
#### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,variables and functions take on new names.

* How does pair programming work?
#### While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
* Why pair program?

#### While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful.

> During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.

1. Greater efficiency.
2. Engaged collaboration.
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
