## LINKS 
### HTML Links - Hyperlinks

* HTML links are hyperlinks.

* You can click on a link and jump to another document.

* When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

### HTML Links - Syntax

The HTML < a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

> < a href="url">link text</ a>
* The most important attribute of the < a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

* The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

* Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

### HTML Links - The target Attribute

- By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

> The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

> The target attribute can have one of the following values:

* _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
* _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
* _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
* _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

### Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

* Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

* A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

### Content
#### The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

* column (often used for mobile browsers)
* column (often used for tablets and laptops)
* column layout (only used for desktops)


### Unequal Columns

#### The main content is the biggest and the most important part of your site.
#### It is common with unequal column widths, so that most of the space is reserved for the main content. The side content (if any) is often used as an alternative navigation or to specify information relevant to the main content. Change the widths as you like, only remember that it should add up to 100% in total:

### Footer

#### The footer is placed at the bottom of your page. It often contains information like copyright and contact info:
