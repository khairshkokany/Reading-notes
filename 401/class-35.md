# Graphs

**A graph** is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

**Termonology**

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

**An Undirected Graph** is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the 

**undirected graph** does not move in any direction.


## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

### Complete Graphs

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### Connected

A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected

A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

The disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edge.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

### Acyclic Graph

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

### Cyclic Graphs

A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Graph Representation

Represent graphs through:

    Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency List

Adjacency Matrix

**An Adjacency matrix** is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Weighted Graphs

**A weighted** graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights
