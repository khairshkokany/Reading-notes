 1. Variables 



- A variable is a name given to a memory location. ... The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location. In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

3. Expression Statment and Blocks

 The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements.It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true. The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false. Unlike if-then and if-then-else,the switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths. The while and do-while statements continually execute a block of statements while a particular condition is true. The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top Therefore, the statements within the do block are always executed at least once. The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. It has two forms, one of which was designed for looping through collections and arrays.

4. control flow 

Java provides three types of control flow statements. 
- a Decision Making statements. if statements. switch statement.
- Loop statements. do while loop. while loop. for loop. for-each loop.
- Jump statements. break statement. continue statement.

## Making Sense of Java’s API Documentation 

Java has a whole collection of grammatical features, but Java is much more than just a big set of grammar rules. Java has a standard Application Programming Interface —a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.

### Searching for a term
You can find things in the API documentation in a number of different ways. Each way is convenient in one situation or another. For example, Java has a method named System.out.println. What follows describes two ways to look up the System.out.println method.
